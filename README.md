## My process

This project is very short, I did this exercise in less than 40 minutes, it was a little complicated for me to center the container but I was able to overcome it.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learn how to center a container, I have read some comments about centering a div in the comments of my previous frontend mentor developers so this time I have centered the container well.


### Continued development

I want to continue learning about responsive design.
